# Latent class analysis \(LCA\)

Identifies unobservable groups/categories within a population using observed variables/indicators

* **Uses**: usually categorical indicators \(e.g. survey response questions\) – continuous indicators would need to be transformed into some categorical representation \(e.g. quintiles\) 
* **Steps:** Choose the number of classes \(e.g., clusters\), run analysis, then test at different class specifications \(e.g., start at two classes, then test at three, then four…\) Optimal model is chosen based on information on fit \(e.g., log likelihood\). Bootstrap likelihood ratio test is also used 
* **Output** The probability of a response to EACH item in the inventory for each latent class. In other words, you’ll see the probability that members of each class had of choosing a given response for each variable
