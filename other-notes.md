# Other Notes



* Condensing multiple observable variables into more abstract, “latent” constructs: Factor Analysis \(and Principal Components Analysis\)
* Clustering methods 
  * k-means clustering 
  * k-medians clustering 
  * k-medoids clustering 
  * Ward’s method \(a/k/a Ward’s minimum variance method\) 
  * Latent class analysis \(LCA\) 
* Evaluation and assessment 
  * Internal \(how effective was the clustering technique?\) 
  * External \(how do the clustering results compare to verified cluster classes?\) 
  * Manual \(how do the clustering results square with ground-truthing?\)
  * Indirect \(how useful is the clustering for the intended purpose?\) Conclusions
